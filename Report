In this phase of the Hands-On Group Project, you will work with your teammates to write a one-page report that describes the Dashboard you created for this project's previous checkpoint. This report will explain how and why you chose the chart types used to visualize your data, as well as the benefits of creating such a dashboard.

This will help you to have a deeper understanding of the technology and charts necessary to render a user-friendly dashboard. As a result, you and your group will be better prepared to present your work. For the presentation, you won't need to create slides; you can instead use the report or dashboard.

With your group, compose a short report that summarizes and analyzes the ideas, work, and conclusions that emerged when creating your dashboard. Why did you choose the chart types you chose? What considerations were made as you designed the charts and selected how to visualize your data?

This report should be 1 page in length.
